# UFOs
## Overview of Project:
This project is meant to offer a mean to mine data regarding UFO sightings and display them in a specific layout:
- Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration, and Comments.

## Analysis:
Using my knowledge of javascript, D3, internet resources I focused on delivering a simple code that meet the requirement for this project. It's been challenging and rewarding. I have genuily attempted to structure the code in way to handle all possible interactions with users. 

##  Summary and Challenges:
The application as built would receive input, in suggested format, and mine the UFO sightings data and display the results. The application could benefit from an injection of 'intuitive' design concepts. Let's start with the data field. The use a calendar widget would present a user with pre-defined date formats and reduce input errors. Since the application is, for now, limited to the United States, the state field could be move up after the date field. This enable to preload states and cities therefore, offering quick choice and accurate naming of states and cities. The same approach could be use for the shape field.

## Conclusion:
This challenge helped me appreciate the possibilities of Web Development. It also highlighted the challenges that lay ahead as I i dive  into learning more of the web developmemnt tools.
